# Oeuvre
A platform-agnostic web/mobile/desktop word processor and project manager with advanced features.

Born out of a desire to merge features of several word processing and project management programs into one application, Oeuvre will allow users to not only write words out on a screen, but to organize and plan their approach, to rearrange the strucure of their documents, and also to see if they've been overusing words or phrases and eliminate that triteness. (At least, that's the intention.) Oeuvre is also intended to be fully compatible with Google Drive and eventually to have integration with other cloud-based services.

Currently working towards basic functionality at the moment, before tackling more advanced features.
